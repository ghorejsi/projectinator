# Projectinator
Project meta templating system for modern development.

# Goal
The goal is to create a simple, easy to use tool that allows you to manage the boilerplate bits of a project. Things like git directory init, vagrant or docker seeding and similar tasks that you find yourself doing over and over. This toolkit contains a set of base templates/rulesets to get your project started quickly. These can be overridden using your own templates and potentially ruleset mixins.
